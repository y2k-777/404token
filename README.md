## How It Works

1. **Token Extraction**:
    - The script scans the user's local Discord files to locate potential tokens using a regular expression.
  
2. **Token Validation**:
    - Each found token is validated by making a request to Discord's API to check its authenticity.

3. **Information Sent**:
    - The script sends the tokens along with system information (OS, machine name, processor, etc.) to the specified Discord webhook.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create a Discord Webhook

- Set up a webhook in any Discord server where you want to receive the token and system information.

### 2. Update the Webhook URL

- Open the script and replace the following line:

    ```python
    WEBHOOK = "YOUR DISCORD WEBHOOK HERE"
    ```

- Replace `"YOUR DISCORD WEBHOOK HERE"` with your actual webhook URL.
